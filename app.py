Before any hacker touches a system, they spend time gathering as much information as possible about the target.\n\nThink of it like a burglar casing a house before breaking in. They study the layout, note the entry points, and identify weaknesses. In cyber security, this phase is called 'recon'.\n\nThe more information an attacker has, the more targeted and effective their attack will be. This is why understanding recon is critical — both for attackers and defenders.",
